              Failed to implement Transaction.id, tried:

              - `Types::TransactionType#id`, which did not exist
              - `Transaction::ActiveRecord_Relation#id`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `#<Transaction::ActiveRecord_Relation:0x00007f4d142b5058>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)

              Failed to implement Transaction.id, tried:

              - `Types::TransactionType#id`, which did not exist
              - `Transaction::ActiveRecord_Relation#id`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `#<Transaction::ActiveRecord_Relation:0x00007ff8e804f428>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)

              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `#<Transaction::ActiveRecord_Relation:0x00007ff8d8be0450>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)

              Failed to implement Transaction.id, tried:

              - `Types::TransactionType#id`, which did not exist
              - `Transaction::ActiveRecord_Relation#id`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `#<Transaction::ActiveRecord_Relation:0x00007ff8d01d3370>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)

              Failed to implement Transaction.id, tried:

              - `Types::TransactionType#id`, which did not exist
              - `Transaction::ActiveRecord_Relation#id`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `#<Transaction::ActiveRecord_Relation:0x00007ff8e408a0b8>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)

              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `true`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)
